## Visual flaws
- I do not own Museo Sans family font; I was not able to test page with this font so I rather used Museo Slab as fallback font. Could be easily switch when source files are available.
- Navigation is not fixed on XS screens; could be easily switch on; from screens itâ€™s not obvious and my preference is not having it there.
- Email function is ready to use but commented out

## Suggested improvements
- Use vector graphics (9 out of 11 figures should be vectors)
- Clearer typography hierarchy
- Clearer Grid and Vertical rhythm definitions
- More consistency between mobile and desktop screens (button's sizes, font sizes logic)
